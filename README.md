# CSE201
Final project for CSE 201

Name: Cognify

Summary: Cognify is an application that holds many different brain games in its user interface. Some of these games include: Wordle, Connections, Memory Trainers, and other brain training related games. You will be able to keep track of your progress through counts of how many days in a row the user has done the games. New games will refresh once a day, so once the user has completed the games, he or she is done. The app will have a home page, where the user can see all the games. Additionally, this page will hold your days in a row that you can share with your friends. Once the user clicks a game, the stopwatch will start for the game. He can go back to the homepage anytime to pause the time. Users will be able to share their times in addition to their day streaks to their friends.
